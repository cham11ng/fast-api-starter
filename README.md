# fastapi-starter

The fastapi-starter project is a Python-based starter template for building web applications using the FastAPI framework and MongoDB as the database. It provides a solid foundation for developing scalable and high-performance APIs.

## Features

- **FastAPI**: FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance for storing and retrieving data.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: The starter template includes built-in support for user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **API Documentation**: FastAPI's automatic interactive API documentation is integrated into the starter template, making it easy to explore and test the API endpoints.
- **Validation and Serialization**: FastAPI leverages Python type hints to automatically validate request data and serialize response data, reducing boilerplate code.
- **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI supports dependency injection, allowing you to easily manage and inject dependencies into your application components.
- **Testing**: The starter template includes a testing framework and sample test cases to help you write robust and reliable tests for your API endpoints.
- **Docker Support**: The project is Docker-ready, making it easy to containerize and deploy your application.
